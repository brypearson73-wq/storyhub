   - What's next

2. **Update BACKLOG.md** with:
   - Feature status changes
   - New insights or requirements

3. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add docs/CONTEXT.md docs/BACKLOG.md
   git commit -m "Update context: [what changed]"

4. **Note for next session:**

## üí° Pro Tips

### Minimize Context Loss
- Always link to GitHub files (not paste contents)
- Use raw GitHub URLs for code files
- Keep CONTEXT.md updated
- Reference specific backlog items by number/name

### Efficient Collaboration
- Be specific about what you need
- Provide relevant code/files upfront
- State your constraints clearly
- Mention what you've already tried

### Managing Conversation Limits
- Break large tasks into smaller focused sessions
- Complete one feature/component per conversation
- Update docs immediately after each session
- Use the templates above for quick context

## üìã Session Checklist

Before ending a Claude conversation:

- [ ] Update CONTEXT.md with progress
- [ ] Update BACKLOG.md feature status
- [ ] Commit and push changes
- [ ] Note what to work on next
- [ ] Save any important code snippets/decisions

## üé™ Example Real Session

Here's what an actual conversation might look like:

```
I'm working on StoryHub, a newsroom content management system.

Context: https://github.com/brypearson73-wq/storyhub/blob/main/docs/CONTEXT.md
Backlog: https://github.com/brypearson73-wq/storyhub/blob/main/docs/BACKLOG.md

We've decided on:
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: React
- Database: PostgreSQL

I want to design the database schema for the Story entity from the backlog.
The Story entity needs to track:
- Headlines, descriptions
- Story owners (reporters/editors with roles)
- Desk/Section assignments
- Publish dates and status
- Links to Stellar content
- Embargo times
- Sponsorship info

Can you help me create the PostgreSQL table definitions and SQLAlchemy models?
```

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå Don't paste entire files - link to them on GitHub
2. ‚ùå Don't forget to update CONTEXT.md after sessions
3. ‚ùå Don't start conversations with "continue from where we left off" (be specific)
4. ‚ùå Don't work on multiple unrelated features in one conversation
5. ‚ùå Don't forget to commit documentation updates
