# 📁 How to Organize Your Files

This guide shows you exactly where to put each file we created.

---

## Step-by-Step File Organization

### 1. Create Your GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub and create a new repository called `storyhub`

### 2. Organize Files Like This

```
storyhub/                          ← Your GitHub repository
│
├── docs/                          ← Create this folder
│   ├── BACKLOG.md                ← Upload here
│   └── CONTEXT.md                ← Upload here
│
├── .env.example                   ← Upload to root
├── .gitignore                     ← Upload to root
├── README.md                      ← Upload to root
├── SETUP.md                       ← Upload to root
├── CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md         ← Upload to root
└── PROJECT_SUMMARY.md            ← Upload to root (optional, just for reference)
```

## 🖥️ Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop:
   - README.md
   - SETUP.md
   - CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md
   - .gitignore

---

## 💻 Method 2: Command Line (If You Have Git)

```bash
# Navigate to where you want the project
cd ~/projects  # or wherever you want it

# Clone your empty repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/storyhub.git
cd storyhub

# Create docs folder
mkdir docs

# Copy files to appropriate locations
# (Assuming downloaded files are in ~/Downloads/storyhub)
cp ~/Downloads/storyhub/README.md .
cp ~/Downloads/storyhub/SETUP.md .
cp ~/Downloads/storyhub/CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md .
cp ~/Downloads/storyhub/.gitignore .
cp ~/Downloads/storyhub/.env.example .
cp ~/Downloads/storyhub/BACKLOG.md docs/
cp ~/Downloads/storyhub/CONTEXT.md docs/

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial project setup with documentation"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

## 🎯 After Upload - Verify Structure

Your repository should look like this on GitHub:

```
storyhub/
├── docs/
│   ├── BACKLOG.md
│   └── CONTEXT.md
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md
├── README.md
└── SETUP.md
```

---

## 🔗 Get Your GitHub Links

After uploading, you'll have these URLs (replace `yourusername`):

**For Claude Conversations:**
```
README: 
https://github.com/yourusername/storyhub/blob/main/README.md

CONTEXT: 
https://github.com/yourusername/storyhub/blob/main/docs/CONTEXT.md

BACKLOG: 
https://github.com/yourusername/storyhub/blob/main/docs/BACKLOG.md

SETUP:
https://github.com/yourusername/storyhub/blob/main/SETUP.md
```

**Save these links!** You'll use them in every Claude conversation.

---

## 📝 Update CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md

After uploading to GitHub:

1. Edit `CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md` on GitHub
2. Replace all `[YOUR-USERNAME]` with your actual GitHub username
3. Replace all `[USERNAME]` with your actual GitHub username
4. Save the changes

Now the templates will have the correct links!

---

## 🚀 You're Ready for Your Next Conversation!

Start your next Claude conversation with:

```
I'm working on StoryHub, a newsroom content management system.

Context: https://github.com/yourusername/storyhub/blob/main/docs/CONTEXT.md
Backlog: https://github.com/yourusername/storyhub/blob/main/docs/BACKLOG.md

Current status: Project setup complete, ready to choose tech stack

I want to decide on: Backend and frontend frameworks
```

---

## 💾 Keep Locally Too

**Pro Tip:** Keep a local copy of these files on your computer:

```
~/projects/storyhub/         ← Local folder
├── docs/
│   ├── BACKLOG.md
│   └── CONTEXT.md
├── README.md
├── SETUP.md
├── CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md
├── .gitignore
└── .env.example
```

This way you can:
- Edit files locally
- Use git to push changes
- Have backup if GitHub is down
- Work offline if needed

---
