## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Upload to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub called `storyhub`
2. Upload all the files we created:
   - README.md
   - SETUP.md
   - CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md
   - .gitignore
   - .env.example
   
3. Create a `docs/` folder and upload:
   - BACKLOG.md
   - CONTEXT.md

### Step 2: Make Key Decisions

You need to decide:

**Backend Framework:**
- [ ] FastAPI (Python) - Fast, modern, type hints
- [ ] Express (Node.js) - Large ecosystem, JavaScript

**Frontend Framework:**
- [ ] React - Large ecosystem, widely known
- [ ] Vue - Easier learning curve

**Database:**
- [x] PostgreSQL (recommended in docs)

### Step 3: Start First Feature

Once tech stack is decided:
1. Set up basic project scaffolding
2. Configure database
3. Design schema for Story entity
4. Create first API endpoint
5. Create first frontend component

## 💡 How to Use This Setup

### Starting Your Next Claude Conversation

Use the template from CLAUDE_QUICK_START.md:

```
I'm working on StoryHub, a newsroom content management system.

Context: [link to CONTEXT.md on GitHub]
Backlog: [link to BACKLOG.md on GitHub]

We've decided on:
- Backend: [your choice]
- Frontend: [your choice]
- Database: PostgreSQL

I want to: [specific task]
```

### Maintaining Context

After each development session:
1. Update CONTEXT.md with what you completed
2. Update BACKLOG.md with feature status changes
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Start next session with links to updated docs

## ✨ Why This Setup Prevents Context Loss

1. **Self-Contained Docs** - Everything Claude needs is in linked files
2. **Version Controlled** - GitHub tracks all changes
3. **Templates** - Quick start templates maintain consistency
4. **Context File** - CONTEXT.md tracks state and decisions
5. **Backlog** - Single source of truth for features

### Before This Setup
- ❌ Had to re-explain project every conversation
- ❌ Lost track of what was decided
- ❌ Wasted time on context repetition
- ❌ Hit conversation limits frequently

### With This Setup
- ✅ Claude reads docs from GitHub
- ✅ All decisions documented
- ✅ Clear status on all features
- ✅ Efficient, focused conversations
- ✅ Easy to pick up where you left off
